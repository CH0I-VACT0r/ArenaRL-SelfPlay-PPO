# ArenaRL-SelfPlay

**A Telemetry-Driven Game Balance Optimization Framework using Self-Play Reinforcement Learning**

Warrior and Mage agents learn competitive PvP combat through a custom PPO implementation, self-play training, and telemetry-driven analysis.
Through multi-objective optimization, self-play agents independently converged toward classic Warrior–Mage archetypes while optimizing gameplay balance.

# Project Overview

This project investigates how reinforcement learning can be applied not only to train competitive game AI, but also to automatically optimize gameplay balance.

Instead of relying solely on designer intuition, self-play agents are used as automated playtesters while telemetry-driven multi-objective optimization searches for balanced gameplay configurations.

The framework combines:

- Custom PPO
- Self-Play Reinforcement Learning
- Gameplay Telemetry
- Optuna Multi-Objective Optimization
- Domain Randomization

The project is organized as a sequence of iterative experiments, where each stage incrementally improves the reinforcement learning framework, gameplay telemetry, and automated balance optimization pipeline.

</p>

The agent outputs **two discrete actions every frame**.

### Branch 0 — Movement (9)

- Stop

- Skill 2
- Skill 3
- Skill 4

This Multi-Discrete action space enables simultaneous movement and skill execution.

# Observation Space

Each agent observes a 31-dimensional state vector.

The observation includes

- Self Status
- Enemy Status
- Relative Distance
- Relative Velocity
- Cooldown State
- Crowd Control State

## Telemetry System
<img src="Docs/demo/telemetry.png" width="1600">

The project automatically records gameplay statistics during training.

Examples include:

- Win Rate
- Damage Dealt
- Damage Taken
- DPS
- Skill Usage
- Skill Hit Rate
- Survival Time
- Average Distance
- Charge Success
- CC Success

Telemetry data is later analyzed to guide reward tuning and game balancing.

---

## Automated Balance Optimization

The trained PPO agents are also used as automated playtesters.

By integrating Optuna with Unity Environment Parameters, gameplay statistics such as HP and damage multipliers are automatically optimized through repeated self-play simulations.

### Optimization Variables

- HP
- Damage
- Movement Speed
- Cooldown Multiplier

### Optimization Objectives
<img src="Docs/demo/optimize_balance.png" width="1600">

The optimization objective is defined as a weighted multi-objective loss:

Loss =
0.35 × Win Rate Gap
+ 0.20 × Survival Penalty
+ 0.15 × Timeout Penalty
+ 0.10 × Hit Rate Penalty
+ 0.10 × Distance Penalty
+ 0.10 × DPS Penalty

The optimizer minimizes a weighted multi-objective loss constructed from gameplay telemetry collected during self-play.

# Design Philosophy

Instead of designing stronger AI,

this project focuses on designing better gameplay through AI.

Self-play agents are treated as automated playtesters.

Telemetry generated from thousands of simulated matches is analyzed to

- improve reward functions,
- discover undesirable behaviors,
- evaluate game balance,
- recommend parameter adjustments.

The long-term objective is an AI-assisted game balancing framework for live-service games.

Rather than treating balance as a collection of handcrafted parameters, this project formulates game balancing as an optimization problem driven by gameplay telemetry.

The framework explores how reinforcement learning can assist designers by automatically searching for parameter configurations while revealing unintended emergent strategies.

Ultimately, the goal is not to replace human designers, but to provide quantitative evidence that supports balance decisions through large-scale automated gameplay simulation.

# Key Contributions

- Implemented a custom PPO framework for asymmetric PvP self-play.
- Designed a telemetry-driven gameplay analysis pipeline using Unity Side Channels.
- Developed a multi-objective balance optimization framework using Optuna.
- Expanded the optimization space from four to eight gameplay parameters.
- Investigated the relationship between optimization objectives and emergent gameplay.
- Demonstrated that increasing optimization dimensionality alone does not necessarily alter emergent combat behavior.
- Showed how reward weighting influences balance outcomes through telemetry-guided analysis.
- Demonstrated how telemetry can be integrated into reinforcement learning-based game balance optimization through Unity ML-Agents Side Channels.

# Research Findings

Throughout eight iterative experiments, several observations emerged.

- Reward shaping significantly influences combat behavior.
- Multi-objective optimization produces more realistic gameplay than win-rate optimization alone.
- Expanding the optimization search space improves flexibility but does not necessarily change emergent strategies.
- Agents repeatedly converged toward kite-oriented combat, suggesting that environment dynamics dominated parameter optimization.
- Effective AI-assisted game balancing requires not only parameter optimization but also careful design of reward functions and combat environments.
